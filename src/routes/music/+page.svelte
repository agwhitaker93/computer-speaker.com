  <h1>I make music</h1>

  <p>Find my music on <a href="https://thinkplumfythoughts.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a></p>

  <p>
    In mid 2020, I bought myself an electric drumkit to help stave off boredom, having shelved the
    instrument when I left home for university.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also dabble in composing electronic music. I started off using Ableton Live, but since
    switching my main PC over to Linux, I have been learning how to use Bitwig Studio.

  <h1>Albums</h1>
  <p>
    My first (and, so far, only) album, <a
      href="https://thinkplumfythoughts.bandcamp.com/album/a-chronology-of-learning-to-make-music"
      >a chronology of learning to make music</a
    >, is intended to catalogue my journey as I learn how to make music.
  </p>
  <p>
    My plan is to keep adding songs to it as I go, to give myself a fun time capsule to show how far
    I've come.
